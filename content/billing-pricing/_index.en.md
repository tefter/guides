### Pricing Plans

#### Individuals

We offer paid plans for individuals and teams. For individuals, one can
upgrade to a **Pro** account which is loaded with more features.

#### Teams

For teams, a paid plan has more seats for members to add and update
content on Tefter. No seats need to be purchased for people to retrieve
content for search, aliases, etc.

Keep in mind that we upgrade every seated member of a workspace to a **Pro** account 
for their personal bookmarks.

To reserve a seat, call the following on slack:

```
/t login
```

### Billing

We process all payments securely through [Stripe](https://stripe.com).

#### Billing Day

If you subscribe to a monthly plan on September 7th, you are billed on the 7th of every month after that.

#### Refunds

We don't issue refunds.

For any questions you may have, shoot an email [here](support@tefter.io).
