For some of the pages you bookmark, we process them so that you can have
a clutter free experience, without ads, trackers or any kind of noise.

Example:

![readable](https://i.imgur.com/Pmx82aq.png)

The readable page is retrieved from our archive of the bookmarked link,
so even if the original page is no longer available we got your back.

Any time you see the book icon on a bookmark card, click it to open
readable mode.
