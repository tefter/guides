There's variety of news sources you can subscribe to and create a personalized feed of the latest and most interesting
things to read. When you follow users and they share bookmarks, they will also appear in [your feed](https://tefter.io).

We're constantly adding new feeds. If there's any news source you'd like to see included, let us know by sending us an [email](mailto:support@tefter.io).

### Filtering

You can search and apply filters in any of our feeds.

For example, you can search across [awesome](https://awesome.re) lists
for Elixir libraries around [Ecto](https://github.com/elixir-ecto/ecto), using https://tefter.io/~awesome/bookmarks?q=elixir&tags=ecto

#### Domains

Clicking on the domain of a bookmark, filters bookmarks by that domain.
