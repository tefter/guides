There are plenty of reasons why you might want to retrieve all the
content you've posted to Tefter. You don't have to worry about lock-in
or Tefter becoming unavailable at some point.

To export your data, go to [your account](https://tefter.io/users/edit)
then select any of the options under "Export your Data".
