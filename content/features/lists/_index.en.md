Lists are a way to organize your bookmarks. The other way is
[tags][tags].

They can either be public, which means that anyone can view them or private.

### Private List Sharing

You can share private lists to anyone on the internet, by generating a
special "share" link.

### List Subscriptions

You can subscribe to lists and be notified each time a bookmark is added.

### Special Lists

From the first time you navigate to [your lists](https://tefter.io/lists), you'll notice two lists. "Favorites" and "Weekend Reads".

You may mark any of your bookmarks as favorite and it'll show up in the "Favorites" list.
